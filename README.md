### Problem Statement  
Build a version of the Stack Overflow page (attached image) using React, Vue, or any framework of your choice.  
* Create a static version for all the design elements, aiming to replicate the design as closely as possible. Pixel-perfect accuracy is preferred.  
* Links and buttons from the design should not perform any action unless explicitly mentioned in the tasks below.  
* Use the Stack Overflow open APIs to populate the question section dynamically:  
  * https://api.stackexchange.com/docs  
  * https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/posts
* Implement filters like "hot", "week", etc., using the API.  
* Sections like the Overflow Blog and others can be hardcoded and do not need to be made dynamic.  
* Bonus: Implement search functionality using the API.  

### Expectations
* Ensure your code quality meets production-level standards.  
* Make regular Git commits to showcase your approach and progress throughout the day.  
* You are free to use any component library and CSS framework.  
* Name and organize files, components, and variables as you would for a production-ready application.
